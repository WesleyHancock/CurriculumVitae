                    <h2>Boom fitness logo</h2>
                    <p class="text">Boom Fitness, a prominent health and fitness brand in South Africa, has established
                    itself as a leader in the industry with an impressive following of over 35,000 Instagram
                    enthusiasts. As their graphic designer, I had the privilege of creating their logo.
                    <span class="moreText"><br><br>
                    To embody the bold and impactful nature of Boom Fitness, I opted for a logo design that exudes
                    strength and energy. I carefully selected a thick typeface with rigid edges, allowing the
                    typography to make a strong statement. The robust letterforms create a sense of solidity
                    and determination, reflecting the brand's commitment to helping individuals achieve their fitness goals.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to infuse an additional layer of dynamism and symbolism into the logo, I incorporated
                    a clever visual element. By leveraging the negative space created by the joining of the two 'o's
                    in the word "boom," I artfully crafted a lightning bolt shape. This integration not only adds an
                    exciting visual element but also represents the explosive energy and rapid progress that individuals
                    can experience through their fitness journey with Boom Fitness.</span></p>

                    <h2>Wheelhouse logo</h2>
                    <p class="text">Wheelhouse, a renowned parent company hosting a diverse portfolio of brands and businesses,
                    required a logo that encapsulated the grandeur of its presence. As their graphic designer,
                    I was tasked with creating a visual identity that harmoniously merged the majestic Burj Khalifa
                    with the symbol of control embodied by the helm of a ship. The result is a logo that seamlessly
                    blends beauty and order, sophistication and guidance.
                    <span class="moreText"><br><br>
                    Drawing inspiration from the Burj Khalifa, an iconic architectural marvel known for its awe-inspiring
                    height and elegance, I incorporated its distinctive silhouette into the logo design. The sleek lines
                    and graceful curves of the Burj Khalifa represent the beauty and refinement that Wheelhouse exudes
                    as a parent company.
                    <br><br>
                    To convey the sense of control and strategic guidance that Wheelhouse provides to its portfolio of brands,
                    I integrated the symbol of a helmâ€”a traditional navigational tool used to steer ships.
                    The helm symbolizes the firm hand that guides and steers businesses towards success, ensuring a
                    steady and purposeful course.
                    <br><br>
                    By fusing these two elementsâ€”the Burj Khalifa and the helmâ€”I created a logo that harmonizes the majesty
                    of architecture with the symbolism of control.</span></p>

                    <span class="moreText"><br><br>
                    The Supercross post demonstrates a clever integration of a complementary hotspot background that enhances the

                    the utilization of negative space, facilitated by the hotspot, effectively directs the viewer's attention towards

                    <p>Goldilocks is my own personal product and brand. I have personally designed everything, I formulated
                    the golden liquid myself, developed the appropriate labeling for the product and went through various
                    testing and sampling variations to develop the handmade packaging that fits the bottle perfectly.
                    I have also designed and managed all of the social media accounts, facebook marketing and directly
                    met with distributers to negotiate stocking my product in their stores.
